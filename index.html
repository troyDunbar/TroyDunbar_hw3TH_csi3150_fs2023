            <h2>What to expect</h2>
            <p>
              When visiting Harlem, one can expect to immerse themselves in a
              vibrant tapestry of culture and history that has played a
              significant role in shaping New York City. This iconic
              neighborhood, known for its rich African American heritage, offers
              a myriad of experiences. Visitors can explore the historic Apollo
              Theater, where legendary artists like Ella Fitzgerald and James
              Brown once graced the stage. Stroll along 125th Street, where
              colorful storefronts, soul food restaurants, and street vendors
              create a bustling atmosphere. Harlem is also a hub for
              contemporary art and music, with galleries and live music venues
              showcasing the talents of local artists. Don't miss the chance to
              savor some authentic soul food or attend a gospel church service
              to truly appreciate the spiritual and musical roots of this
              vibrant community. Harlem invites visitors to engage with its past
              and present, providing a unique and unforgettable New York
              experience.

            <h2>Times of the year: reservations</h2>
            <p>
              The best time to visit Harlem largely depends on your personal
              preferences and what you hope to experience. Spring and fall are
              typically considered the optimal times. In spring, the
              neighborhood awakens with blooming flowers and moderate weather,
              making it perfect for outdoor exploration. Fall brings pleasant
              temperatures and the added charm of autumn foliage, ideal for
              cultural visits and historical exploration without the summer
              crowds. However, if you enjoy lively events and festivities,
              summer offers numerous outdoor festivals and concerts. While
              winters can be chilly, the holiday season in Harlem, with its
              festive decorations and cultural events, can also be a special
              time to visit. So, the best time to experience Harlem truly
              depends on your interests and the kind of atmosphere you're
              seeking.
